# 🚀 AI-Dev-Agile V4

## Agentic Workflow for Intelligent, Reliable Software Development

**From idea to production-ready code, with AI that adapts to your stack and tools.**

---

## 🎯 What is AI-Dev-Agile?

**AI-Dev-Agile** is an **agentic development workflow** that intelligently orchestrates multiple specialized AI agents to transform your business requirements into production-quality code.

Unlike improvised approaches where you prompt AI without structure, which produces code that's often fragile and hard to maintain, AI-Dev-Agile structures development into **validated stages**, with **specification as the source of truth**.

> *"From idea to deployable code, without friction or errors."*

## 💎 What Makes AI-Dev-Agile Unique

### 🔄 Total Flexibility: Your AI coding tool, Your Stack

AI-Dev-Agile **adapts to your environment**, not the other way around.

#### Choose Your AI coding tool
At setup, you select your preferred AI coding tool. The workflow automatically adapts to leverage each tool's specific capabilities while maintaining the same structured process.

**Supported AI coding tool:**
- Anthropic Claude Code
- Google Gemini
- Cursor
- OpenAI Codex / GPT
- GitHub Copilot
- Any other AI coding tool via generic interface

#### Choose Your Tech Stack
The system **automatically detects** your existing stack or lets you configure it manually. Whether your project uses:
- Any backend language (Java, C#, Python, Node.js, Go, Rust...)
- Any frontend framework (React, Angular, Vue, Svelte...)
- Any mobile technology (cross-platform or native)
- Any database

AI-Dev-Agile adapts its agents and validation rules to **your specific context**.

**Benefit:** One workflow, infinite configurations. No vendor lock-in.

---

### 🤖 Specialized Multi-Agent Architecture

Rather than a generalist assistant that does everything (often poorly), AI-Dev-Agile uses a **team of specialized agents** that collaborate intelligently:

| Agent | Expertise |
|-------|-----------|
| **Orchestrator** | Workflow coordination and sequencing |
| **Analyst** | Requirements understanding, ambiguity clarification |
| **Architect** | Technical design, patterns, contracts |
| **Designer** | Interfaces, user experience, accessibility |
| **Security Auditor** | Vulnerabilities, compliance, best practices |
| **Developers** | Implementation by technical domain |

Each agent masters its domain and applies its specialty's best practices. The orchestrator coordinates their work to ensure overall consistency.

**Benefit:** Expert quality on every aspect of development.

---

### 🧠 Intelligent Context Persistence (Memory Bank)

The major problem with current AI tools: **they forget everything between sessions**. You have to repeat the same information, re-explain your architecture, re-specify your conventions.

AI-Dev-Agile solves this with a **Memory Bank** that persists and synchronizes project context:

#### What the Memory Bank Retains

- **Project context**: Name, phase, objectives, business constraints
- **Architectural decisions**: Every technical choice is documented with its justification
- **Validated tech stack**: Only approved technologies can be used
- **Team conventions**: Styles, patterns, specific preferences
- **Lessons learned**: Past mistakes don't repeat
- **Project constitution**: Immutable rules that all agents respect

#### Concrete Benefits

- **Instant resumption**: If you interrupt a session, work resumes exactly where it stopped
- **Guaranteed consistency**: All agents share the same understanding of the project
- **Accelerated onboarding**: New team members immediately benefit from accumulated context
- **Controlled evolution**: Past decisions guide future ones

**Benefit:** AI becomes a real team member who knows the project history.

---

### 🛡️ Protection Against Hallucinations

AI tools can produce code that "looks correct" but:
- Uses non-existent packages or incompatible versions
- Invents APIs or methods that don't exist
- Contradicts established architecture
- Forgets files or generates incomplete code

AI-Dev-Agile integrates **multiple protection levels**:

#### Input Validation
Before development starts, the system verifies that requirements are complete and consistent. When ambiguous, AI asks clarification questions rather than guessing.

#### Consistency Verification
Each generation is validated against:
- The project's existing architecture
- Conventions defined in the Memory Bank
- Authorized dependencies and packages
- Established patterns and styles

#### Completeness Control
The system verifies that all planned files were created and that generated code is complete, not truncated or partial.

#### Automated Assertions
Generated code passes through a set of assertions covering multiple quality dimensions. On failure, the system attempts auto-correction before escalating to human.

**Benefit:** Code that compiles and integrates correctly on the first attempt.

### 📋 Structured Development with Human Validation

AI-Dev-Agile guides development through **structured stages**, each with a human control point:

#### Key Principle: AI Proposes, You Decide

- At each key stage, you see what was produced
- You validate before moving forward
- You can request adjustments
- The workflow only continues if you're satisfied

**Benefit:** Total transparency. No black box. You stay in control.

---

### 🔒 Contracts Locked Before Development

A classic problem: frontend and backend develop in parallel but with different assumptions about APIs, causing integration conflicts.

AI-Dev-Agile solves this:

1. **Interface contracts are defined and validated** before development starts
2. **These contracts are locked** and serve as reference for all agents
3. **Any deviation is detected** and automatically flagged
4. **Integration tests** are generated from these contracts

**Benefit:** Frontend and backend can develop in parallel without integration conflicts.

---

### ⚡ Intelligent Auto-Correction

When generated code doesn't pass validations, AI-Dev-Agile doesn't stop there:

1. **Root cause analysis**: Precise problem identification
2. **Correction attempt**: The responsible agent corrects automatically
3. **Re-validation**: Verification that correction is effective
4. **Limited iteration**: Maximum attempts to avoid infinite loops
5. **Escalation if needed**: Human intervention requested if auto-correction fails

**Benefit:** Fewer manual back-and-forths. AI solves its own errors.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### How is AI-Dev-Agile different from a classic code assistant?

Classic assistants complete your code line by line. AI-Dev-Agile orchestrates a **complete workflow** with multiple specialized agents, from requirements analysis to validated and tested code. It's the difference between a tool and a process.

### Can AI do anything in my project?

No. You validate each key stage. Generated code passes through automated assertions. The stack is locked in the Memory Bank. Any deviation is detected and blocked.

### How does the system avoid hallucinations?

Multiple combined mechanisms: input validation, consistency verification with project context, authorized package control, assertions on generated code, and auto-correction when problems occur.

### Can I use my preferred AI coding tool?

Yes. AI-Dev-Agile supports major market AI coding tools and offers a generic interface for others. You choose at setup.

### What if my stack isn't supported?

The system automatically detects common stacks and allows manual configuration for others. The architecture is designed to be extensible.

### How long to configure?

Basic configuration: 15 minutes. Complete Memory Bank customization: varies by project complexity.
